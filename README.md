# Dexterity-Game
A small game testing your dexterity and accuracy, created with JavaScript and TailwindCSS. Click the four black squares as quickly as possible without clicking on any white squares. 
When you have clicked more than 10 squares, a score will be calculated by dividing the amount of clicks by the time it took. The more clicks per second, the better the score.
